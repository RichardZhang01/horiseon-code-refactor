# Horiseon Code Refactor
> By Richard Zhang

## Description

- The motivation behind this project is to learn how to refactor source code. That is to improve the provided code without necessarily changing what it does. 
- Junior developers are commonly given code to refactor, and my goal is to eventually become a programmer, so this is a good way to learn.
- The main goal of refactoring the provided source code is to make it more **accessible**.
- I hope to learn a bit about the general layout of webpages in this exercise, the connections between html, CSS, and JavaScript used, and of course how to properly refactor the provided code.
